# LifeCycle-BE

My Social Network Project's Back End, made in ASP.NET Core 5 Web API

The Source Code contains, at the moment:

**EF Core** using **SQLServer** DB config & models, **JWT Authentication + Refresh Token**, Password one-way encrypting using **KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2**

will contain: 

**SignalR Real-Time Communication & Chatting**, **E-Mail Service & Two-Factor Authentication**

My Project has the only purpose of developing my own skills & other developer's so feel free to check out and get/provide help with the source code
